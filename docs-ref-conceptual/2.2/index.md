# Cognitive Toolkit Python API (vLatest)

[CNTK](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cognitive-toolkit/), the Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit, is a system for describing, training,
and executing computational networks. It is also a framework for describing
arbitrary learning machines such as deep neural networks (DNNs). CNTK is an
implementation of computational networks that supports both CPU and GPU.
