  summary: 'This operation computes the classification error. It finds the index of
    the highest

    value in the output_vector and compares it to the actual ground truth label

    (the index of the hot bit in the target vector). The result is a scalar

    (i.e., one by one matrix). This is often used as an evaluation criterion.

    It cannot be used as a training criterion though since the gradient is not

    defined for it.

  summary: 'Edit distance error evaluation function with the option of specifying
    penalty of substitution, deletion and insertion, as well as squashing the input
    sequences and ignoring certain samples.

    Using the classic DP algorithm as described in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edit_distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edit_distance),
    adjusted to take into account the penalties.


    Each sequence in the inputs is expected to be a matrix. Prior to computation of
    the edit distance, the operation extracts the indices of maximum element in each
    column.

    For example, a sequence matrix


    1 2 9 1


    3 0 3 2


    will be represented as the vector of labels (indices) as [1, 0, 0, 1], on which
    edit distance will be actually evaluated.


    The function allows to squash sequences of repeating labels and ignore certain
    labels. For example, if squashInputs is true and tokensToIgnore contains index
    of label ''-'' then

    given first input sequence as s1="1-12-" and second as s2="-11--122" the edit
    distance will be computed against s1'' = "112" and s2'' = "112".


    When used as an evaluation criterion, the Trainer will aggregate all values over
    an epoch and report the average, i.e. the error rate.

    Primary objective of this node is for error evaluation of CTC training, see formula
    (1) in "Connectionist Temporal Classification: Labelling Unsegmented

    Sequence Data with Recurrent Neural Networks", @ftp://ftp.idsia.ch/pub/juergen/icml2006.pdf

    the NDCG at 1 is:

    Samples in the same group must appear in order of decreasing gain.


    It returns the average NDCG at 1 across all the groups in the minibatch
