  summary: 'Layer factory function to create a function that runs a step function
    recurrently over an input sequence,

    and returns the final state.

    This is often used for embeddings of sequences, e.g. in a sequence-to-sequence
    model.


    `Fold()` is the same as @cntk.layers.sequence.Recurrence except that only the
    final state is returned

    (whereas `Recurrence()` returns the entire state sequence).

    Hence, this documentation will only focus on the differences to `Recurrence()`,

    please see @cntk.layers.sequence.Recurrence for a detailed information on parameters.


    Commonly, the `folder_function` is a recurrent block such as an LSTM.

    However, one can pass any binary function. E.g. passing `plus` will sum

    up all items of a sequence; while `element_max` would perform a max-pooling over
    all items of the sequence.


    Note: CNTK''s Fold() is similar to the fold() catamorphism known from functional
    programming.

    `go_backwards=False` corresponds to a fold-left, and `True` to a fold-right,

    except that the `folder_function` signature is always the one of fold-left.

  summary: 'Layer factory function to create a function that runs a step function
    recurrently over an input sequence.

    This implements the typical recurrent model.


    The step function can be any @cntk.ops.functions.Function or Python function

    with a signature `(h_prev, x) -> h`, where `h_prev` is the previous state, `x`
    is the new

    data input, and the output is the new state.

    All three are sequences of the same length. The step function will be called item
    by item.


    Step functions can have more than one state output, e.g. @cntk.layers.blocks.LSTM.

    In this case, the first N arguments are the previous state, followed by one more
    argument that

    is the data input; and its output must be a tuple of N values.

    In this case, the recurrence operation will, by default, return the first of the
    state variables

    (in the LSTM case, the `h`), while additional state variables are internal (like
    the LSTM''s `c`).

    If all state variables should be returned, pass `return_full_state=True`.


    Typical step functions are @cntk.layers.blocks.LSTM, @cntk.layers.blocks.GRU,
    and @cntk.layers.blocks.RNNUnit.

    However, any function with a signature as described above is admissible.

    For example, a cumulative sum over a sequence can be computed as `Recurrence(plus)`,

    or a GRU layer with projection could be realized as `Recurrence(GRU(500) >> Dense(200))`;

    where the projection is applied to the hidden state as fed back to the next step.

    `F>>G` is a short-hand for `Sequential([F, G])`.


    Optionally, the recurrence can run backwards. This is useful for constructing
    bidirectional models.


    `initial_state` must be a constant. To pass initial_state as a data input, e.g.
    for a sequence-to-sequence

    model, use @cntk.layers.sequence.RecurrenceFrom instead.


    Note: `Recurrence()` is the equivalent to what in functional programming is often
    called `scanl()`.

  summary: 'Layer factory function to create a function that implements a recurrent
    generator.

    Starting with a seed state, the `UnfoldFrom()` layer

    repeatedly applies `generator_function` and emits the sequence of results.

    `UnfoldFrom(f)(s)`

    emits the sequence `f(s), f(f(s)), f(f(f(s))), ...`.

    `s` can be tuple-valued.


    A typical application is the decoder of a sequence-to-sequence model,

    the generator function `f` accepts a two-valued state, with the first

    being an emitted word, and the second being an internal recurrent state.

    The initial state would be a tuple `(w0, h0)`

    where `w0` represents the sentence-start symbol,

    and `h0` is a thought vector that encodes the input sequence (as obtained

    from a @cntk.layers.sequence.Fold operation).


    A variant allows the state and the emitted sequence to be different. In that case,

    `f` returns a tuple (output value, new state), and

    `UnfoldFrom(f)(s)`

    would emit the sequence `f(s)[0], f(f(s)[1])[0], f(f(f(s)[1])[1])[0], ...`.


    The maximum length of the output sequence is not unlimited, but determined by
    the argument to

    the layer function, multiplied by an optional increase factor.


    Optionally, a function can be provided to denote that the end of the sequence
    has been reached.


    Note: In the context of functional programming, the first form of this operation
    is known as the unfold() anamorphism.

        should have

        a tuple of N+1 outputs, where the first output is the value to emit, while
        the others are the state.

        for the last element of the sequence, and 0 otherwise.
